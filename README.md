# ProblemSolvingApp

Designed and developed an app that helps users solve difficult/big problems by providing them with
a template to break problems into smaller/easier ones, then to break those sub-problems into even
smaller ones continuing this process until the problems are at a manageable level.

• Programmed in Python. Implemented using double linked lists and DFS/BFS(AKA breadth first/ depth first search)

• Explored and implemented a variety of data-structures while creating previous iterations of
this app including dictionaries, hash tables, and many ways of using arrays

• Wrote the app in a way that understood when to use efficient code, or when to write code
that could be applied across a broad range of scenarios sacrificing efficiency for simplicity of
code
